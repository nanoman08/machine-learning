    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",

    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "For this project, I originally chose 3 different models: SVM, GuassinNB and RandomForrest. But while working on this project I also learned the AdaBoosting model from the Machine Learning course offered by Udacity and found it quite useful, so I've added the AdaBoosting as the 4th model also.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* SVM: \n",
    "    * For general applications, on the scikit-learn.org I found an example for using SVM to hand-writing digits recognition. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_digits_classification.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-classification-plot-digits-classification-py. Also from Wikipedia it states SVM is useful in text and hypertext categorization and also in Classification of images, although nowadays Deep Learning (neural nets) dominates for images/text classifications.\n",
    "    * The strength of SVM is definitely the advantage of using the kernel trick to create non-linear decision boundaries, which helps to study very complicated non-linear intercation between different features in the dataset. Also it uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), which is memory efficient.\n",
    "    * Weakness: SVMs are problematic if there are too many data points and features. In the scikit-learn documentation, it states the computation complexity scales between O(n_{features}* n_{samples}^2) and O(n_{features} * n_{samples}^3) due to solving a quadratic programming probilem, which the computation time will be exploded for large datasets/features. For this problem, the sample size is quite large ~ 36k so the training time might become a major issues when comparing to other learning algorithm.\n",
    "    * Reason for choosing this model: For this income classicification problem, there might be a clear boundary between some features that the SVM would be a very powerful learning algorithm and it is a very powerful learner to explore the corrleation between the features. \n",
    "\n",
    "* GaussianNB\n",
    "    * For general applications, GaussianNB has been widely used in Spam filter for emails. The general concept of Naive Bayes classifier is based on applying Bayes's theorem with the \"naive\" assumption of the indepence ibetween the input variables (features). The distribtion of features vs. different categories are constructed from the training samples and used to build the models. \n",
    "    * The strength of GaussianNB is the very fast training speed since it is such a simple model compared to other more sophisticated algorithms. Since each feature is an indepenet variable, the curse of exploding tranining time due to increasing dimensionality is not in the play for Naive Bayes type classifier. \n",
    "    * Weakness: It will not work that well if the intercation between features play an important role in the dataset.\n",
    "    * Reason for choosing this model:  I chose this model because I'd like to use a very fast and efficient learning algorithm and compare the results to other algorithms. And the concept befind Naive Bayes fits in the income classification problem also, the features probability (P(X|Y) of the high income family should be very similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "* AdaBoosting:\n",
    "    * For general applications, boosting is more like a methodology on top of all the different algorithms; an algorithm of how to use many weighted weak learners to get the best predictions. So boosting in general can be applied in all kinds of problems. This is also the main reason why Boosting is probably the most popular techinque in the Kaggle community.\n",
    "    * The strength of Adaboosting is that it is a very powerful learner since it utlizes a lot of weak learners to learn and do the prediction, and it is also a fast learner and also less prone to over-fitting. During each iteration of learning, it enhances the weight on the mis-classified labels so the new added learner can focus to learn more on those cases to improve the learning ensemble's performance.   \n",
    "    * Weakness: Since Adaboosting is the combination of group of weak learners, one drawback is the lack of interpretability. Unlike the linear classifier, it's hard to study the input variables's relation to the final prediction for Adaboosting. Also AdaBoost’s procedure is suboptimal since a weak learner is never updated once it is added into the learner. AdaBoosting is also vuleranble to outlier and noise due to the exponential loss function, AdaBoosting will try to minimize the loss which will cause the algorithm to minize to the minimum loss but also ends up at not the best learner.   \n",
    "    * Reason for choosing this model: Boosting in general works well in most kinds of problem with clean dataset, so by using AdaBoosting with Decision Tree, it should provide a good learner for this problem."
